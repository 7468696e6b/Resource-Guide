# Chinese-English Exchange Resources

The resource document list for the Chinese-English exchange discord server: https://discord.gg/ADdR45y. Mostly tailors to learning Mandarin and Cantonese. Links dialects, Classical, and older Chinese however are more than welcome.

If you find any problems with these resources listed or have suggestions, please leave comments in the resources channel of the discord. Many of these links have not been vetted, so usage experience is more than welcome.

Mandarin and Cantonese lessons sections should be focused around getting a person with no knowledge to beginner/intermediate level. Once they reach that point, they should be looking towards native content for self-study.
